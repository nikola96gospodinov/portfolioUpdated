                    My path towards Front End Development began way back in 2012 when I was still in high school when I took a <b>C++</b> class. This was my introduction to programming and although at the present moment I don’t remember anything in C++ I remember two things from this class. It made sense and I was good at it… At least compared to the other students. As a shy introverted kid that’s good in Maths, it made sense to study Computer Science at university. And that’s how at the end of 2014 when I was starting my application process for universities I choose <b>Computer Science</b> as my field.<br/><br/>
                    In the summer of 2015 after months of hard work, I received the results from my exams which were better than I needed. I was accepted at <b>University of Liverpool</b> - my first choice. <br/><br/>
                    The first semester was crazy as I was really struggling with everything. That is when I got introduced to the fundamentals of <b>Java and MySQL</b>. Although I remembered being good at C++ I didn’t remember anything from the course I took in high school and to my surprise at first Java was making no sense. I found MySQL a bit easier though. By the end of the semester, I was still struggling but I kept finding a way to produce course work that was bringing me good marks. <br/><br/>
                    After successfully finishing the first semester in the second semester I got introduced to <b>HTML and CSS</b>. This clicked with me immediately. Although looking at it now I was building pretty simple websites that looked absolutely terrible I was enjoying myself for the first time since I started university.<br/><br/>
                    During my second year, I continued with Java and I got introduced to scripting languages. I first got into <b>Pearl</b>, then <b>PHP</b> and finally Into <b>JavaScript</b>. I got introduced to ES4/ES5 Javascript although at the time (early 2017) browsers were already starting to support ES6. Still, JavaScript made the most sense out of the 3 languages.

                <p style = {TextStyle}>
                    During the third year, I actually started learning some skills on my own which were going to be useful in a working environment, unlike the outdated and sometimes useless information I was studying in university. During the first semester, I took part-time jobs as a <b>door-to-door fundraiser</b> and then as a sales representative. By having to rely on my social skills to do a good job I realized how bad they were and how much I need to improve my English if I really want to be successful. That is when I emersed myself into books and podcasts on improving social skills but the true breakthrough began to happen the following year. <br/><br/>
                    During my second semester, I realized that I was going to graduate soon and I still didn’t have many technical skills to impress a potential employer. That is when I got into <b>WordPress</b> and Online <b>Marketing</b>. During the first half of the second semester, I was trying to master WordPress and create a website from scratch. After two months of trying to figure things out and trying out different things, I finally created a website. At the time I was really proud of what I’ve done but again looking back at it now it was pretty basic and unappealing. Around the time I finished the website I started going around different events and workshops focused on online marketing. One of those meetings was organized by an owner of a social media marketing company who I asked for advice on my website. Expecting some kind of an amazing response I got a bit stunned when he told me that the website was nothing special even below average. At first, I got defensive. In my opinion, the website was brilliant but I still listened to his feedback. He went on to tell me about <b>UI</b> and <b>UX design</b> and the importance of <b>copywriting</b>. He then sent me some relevant material based on which I could apply some basic principles and take my website from below average to close to professional. I didn’t look at the materials but after visiting another workshop I realized that my website wasn’t as good as I thought it was. I went through the materials and I realized how fundamentally wrong my website was. I had to start all over again but after getting the fundamentals of WordPress and learning how to work with various plugins including <b>Elementor</b> I managed to create an almost professional looking website in less than 2 weeks.

                <h2 style = {HeadingStyle}>Developing My Skills</h2>
                <p style = {TextStyle}>
                    After getting into WordPress I naturally went into <b>Online Marketing</b> and spend the remaining time of the semester and the majority of my summer after graduation learning all about it. I got into <b>email marketing</b> first and went through a course by <b>Pat Flynn</b> (from the “Smart Passive Income”) and learned about the different types of sequences, how to automate the process of creating a funnel and how to group subscribers into “buckets”. That naturally led me to <b>Facebook messenger marketing</b> where most of the same principles apply. I then got into <b>Facebook ads</b> for a while going over some of <b>Michael Stelzner’s</b> content (from “Social Media Marketing”). I also got over some of <b>Michael Hyatt’s</b> content on <b>keyword research</b>. Hyatt’s content led me to <b>copywriting</b> and <b>storytelling</b>. Finally, I go interested in <b>Instagram</b> content creation and that led me to <b>Photoshop</b> and taking a course on some core Photoshop CS6/CC skills. <br/><br/>
                    In the meantime, I was determined to improve my social skills and after realizing that reading a bunch of books and listening to a bunch of podcasts on the subject is not going to do anything unless I start practicing what I was learning. I started by trying to improve my <b>non-verbal communication</b> by working on posture, eye contact, hand gestures and everything in between. I soon realized that non-verbal communication is not enough so I made the decision to find a job that is going to allow me to speak with many people regularly that is why I started working at a till where I had the opportunity to speak with at times over hundred people per day. I could test different non-verbal cues like slightly raising my eyebrows and tilting my head after initially seeing someone for a friendlier response, I could work on my voice and most importantly I was trying to start a conversation with everyone. Actively trying to increase my confidence and working on my social skills for the last 6 months made me so much better socially that now people get surprised when I tell them that I am actually more of an introvert. By no means, I am to the level that I want to be but the difference in the last couple of months is huge. <br/><br/>
                    When it comes to my technical skills after finishing university I thought that because I know WordPress I will be okay but as I was trying to create a website for my father’s business I realized how limited I was with WordPress and I realized that I want a lot more freedom in the development process. I got back into <b>HTML and CSS</b>. I’ve completed a couple of courses on the subject and got deeper into CSS by going into <b>SASS, REM, Flexbox and CSS Grid</b>. The natural next step was <b>JavaScript</b> but before starting with it I got back into <b>UI and UX design</b>. I got into <b>Steve Krug’s</b> material on UX design and for UI design I just revisited the 5 fundamental principles in a bit more detail. After starting a course on JavaScript with the idea to “revise” the concepts from university I realized that although similar to ES5, the new version <b>ES6</b> still had its challenges. I spend a bit more time than I wished I had on ES6 but I knew that it was essential to get it right so I can easily get into <b>React</b>. Getting into React was easier than I expected and with good working knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript the learning curve was small. The logical next step was <b>Redux</b> which proved to be a bit more challenging.

                    After acquiring the fundamental skills of Front End Development and using them in a couple of personal projects I am quite excited to apply those skills in a working environment where I can develop them even further. <br/><br/>
                    Right now I am in the process of learning <b>Node.js</b> and after that, I have my eyes on <b>MongoDB</b> so I can slowly transition into <b>Back End Development</b> as well so I can ultimately get into <b>Full Stack Development</b>.
